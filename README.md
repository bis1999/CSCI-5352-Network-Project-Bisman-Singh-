   Prediction of polypharmacy side effect using network analysis and machine learning 
   When treating diseases such as Cancer, HIV or even some ailments like cough and cold. A lot of time the patients are prescribed multiple drugs. Now the simultaneous usage of drugs is known as polypharmacy. The simultaneous usage of drugs may lead to one or more side effects. The problem is which pairs of drugs may or may not lead to certain side effects. This problem can be viewed as a link prediction problem. Where the nodes are the drugs and the link represents the existence of side effects. In this project , the aim would be to solve this link prediction problem by the help of network analysis and machine learning.
